This vimscript allows you to search Google inside Vim. You just need to enter the command ":Google <search_term>" and Vim will switch to text-based browser 'links' and search Google for <search_term> just entered.

Example: :Google vim rocks

To quit from links and return back to Vim click on 'q' then 'Enter' twice.
